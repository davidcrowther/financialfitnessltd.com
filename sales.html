    <h3 class="text-center">Some Important Questions You Need To Ask Yourself...</h3>
    <p class="with-pointer"><span class="icon icon-arrow-3"></span>What happens if someone gets hurt while working directly with you or while at your business?</p>
    <p class="with-pointer"><span class="icon icon-arrow-3"></span>What if they claim they were hurt or injured while performing a task based on your instruction or your recommendation?</p>
    <p class="with-pointer"><span class="icon icon-arrow-3"></span>Are you and your business protected in the event of this highly unfortunate situation?</p>
    <p class="with-pointer v1"><strong>Here&#8217;s another scenario you should probably consider the answers to...</strong></p>
    <p class="with-pointer v2"><span class="icon icon-arrow-3"></span>What if you were held accountable for someone else&#8217;s property being damaged?</p>
    <p class="with-pointer v3"> If you are not properly covered, your business could be completely wiped out, financially. <br> You probably think this is something so far fetched…</p>
    <p class="with-pointer v2"><span class="icon icon-arrow-3"></span>It couldn&#8217;t possibly happen to you, right?</p>
    <p class="with-pointer v2">You&#8217;ve probably told yourself things like:</p>
    <ul class="with-gray-pointers">
      <li><span class="icon icon-arrow-1"></span> You&#8217;re extremely careful, therefore you&#8217;re not at risk</li> 
      <li><span class="icon icon-arrow-1"></span> This is the kind of thing that happens to other businesses</li> 
      <li><span class="icon icon-arrow-1"></span> Why would anyone try and sue you, you&#8217;re not a huge corporation?</li> 
      <li><span class="icon icon-arrow-1"></span> The type of customers you deal with would never take advantage of you</li> 
      <li><span class="icon icon-arrow-1"></span> Your facilities are extremely safe, so there is no risk of anything bad happening</li> 
    </ul>
    <p class="empty">The truth is you really don&#8217;t know what might happen in any given situation.</p>
    <p class="empty">You could be the most careful person on the planet, but accidents still happen.</p>
    <p class="empty">Not only that, the accident might not have even been your fault to begin with.</p>
    <p class="empty">It doesn&#8217;t matter.</p>

    <h3 class="text-center"> Some Important Questions You Need To Ask Yourself... </h3>
    <p>You&#8217;ve heard the expression “It&#8217;s better to have it and not need it than to need it and not have it,” right?</p>
    <p>Yes, that IS the truth with insurance, however…</p>
    <p>There are two critical questions most fitness and athletic experts really need to ask themselves:</p>
    <p class="with-pointer"><span class="icon icon-arrow-3"></span> What type of cover is right for me?</p>
    <p class="with-pointer last"><span class="icon icon-arrow-3"></span> How much cover do I need?  </p>
    <p>Too often, insurance experts don&#8217;t fully understand what you do, so their solutions are typically one size fits all and their offers are, generally, very generic.</p>

<article class="tragic-story">
  <div class="container">
    <h3 class="text-center">Tragic But True Story...</h3>
    <p>Personal Trainers are notoriously bad at administrative organisation.</p>
    <p>They typically just want to “get to work” with their clients, making their lives better.</p>
    <p>But taking just a little bit of time to take care of a minor administrative detail could have saved this Personal Trainer from losing their entire business...</p>
    <p>Here&#8217;s what happened:</p>
    <blockquote>
      <cite>The uninsured Personal Trainer was once training a female client when, unexpectedly, the client pulled a muscle in her lower back.</cite>
      <cite>Of course, since this happened while working with the Personal Trainer at the gym, some responsibility fell on the shoulders of the trainer.</cite>
      <cite>The client went home and was advised by her GP to take leave from work to rest and recuperate.</cite>
      <cite>Ads on TV and recommendations from friends influenced the client to sue the Personal Trainer for damages.</cite>
      <cite>The amount she won - <strong>£10,000!</strong></cite>
      <cite>The Personal Trainer, who was forced to pay from his own pocket with money he didn&#8217;t have, was crushed.</cite>
      <cite>He was literally ruined financially because he didn&#8217;t have the right cover.</cite>

    <h3 class="text-center">This Should Scare You And It Might Even Make You Angry</h3>
    <p class="with-pointer"><span class="icon icon-arrow-3"></span> So, let me ask you, do you know what type of public liability insurance cover you need?</p>
    <p class="with-pointer v2"><span class="icon icon-arrow-3"></span> Are you confident that your cover needs are just right or are you afraid of making a poor choice?</p>
    <p class="with-pointer v3"><span class="icon icon-arrow-3"></span> Don&#8217;t you hate when you have tons of options with no real understanding of the various differences in each choice?</p>
    <p class="with-pointer v3">Imagine working directly with someone that understands the unique nuances of your business because they work only with others in your field that are just like you.</p>
    <p class="with-pointer v3"><span class="icon icon-arrow-3"></span> What sort of confidence might you have in an insurance agent that fully understands you and your business needs?</p>
    <p class="with-pointer"><span class="icon icon-arrow-3"></span> How much easier do you think it would be to decide what cover to get if they could help you cut through all the fluff and remove any of the unnecessary add ons that most agents might try and sell to you and that you don&#8217;t need...</p>
    <p>At <strong>Financial Fitness Group</strong>, we pride ourselves in being the only public liability insurance provider that works exclusively for fitness and athletic professionals like you because we are fitness and athletic professionals ourselves.</p>
    <p>You&#8217;ll be glad knowing you&#8217;re covered no matter what your specific fitness or athletic field of interest.</p>

    <h3 class="text-center">Why Work With Us?</h3>
    <p>So now that you know we specialise in your field, let me tell you why you might want to work with us.</p>
    <p>Before focusing on helping you and other fitness and athletic pros, we noticed there were a few critical questions that most clients did not have the answer to:</p>
    <p class="with-pointer"><span class="icon icon-arrow-3"></span>  How much cover is the optimal amount?</p>
    <p class="with-pointer"><span class="icon icon-arrow-3"></span>  What should the standard rate for personal accident cover be?</p>
    <p class="with-pointer"><span class="icon icon-arrow-3"></span>  What sort of cover should be standard at a bare minimum?</p>
    <p class="with-pointer"><span class="icon icon-arrow-3"></span>  What sort of minimum viable premium options should be available to you?</p>
    <p>These were questions that had no standardised answers in your industry and the reason why was because no one bothered to dig in and consider what was needed from a minimum viability standpoint.</p>
    <p>Why?</p>
    <p>We figured you would appreciate knowing exactly what you were paying for.</p>
    <p>We figured you&#8217;d like knowing that you weren&#8217;t paying for excess cover that didn&#8217;t pertain to you and wasn&#8217;t necessary.</p>
    <p>We discovered quickly that you might like knowing cover was specifically geared to your business.</p>
    <p>And guess what…</p>
    <p>We were right.</p>

<article class="kind-of-cover">
  <div class="container">
    <h3 class="text-center">So what type of cover can you expect from us?</h3>
    <p>How about:</p>
    <ul class="with-green-pointers">
      <li><span class="icon icon-arrow-2"></span>   Option of £5 million or £10 million cover *</li>
      <li><span class="icon icon-arrow-2"></span>   £50,000 Personal Accident cover included as standard</li>
      <li><span class="icon icon-arrow-2"></span>   £1500 of PT Kit Cover included as standard</li>
      <li><span class="icon icon-arrow-2"></span>   A rolling policy payable by monthly direct debit (no renewal date) you are covered for as long as you continue to pay </li>
      <li><span class="icon icon-arrow-2"></span> £5m cover is just £12 per month, and £10m cover – £17 per month</li> 
    </ul>
    <p class="italic">* You may need £10m if an employer insists on it, or you are working in local authority properties (schools, community centers etc.)</p>

<article class="significants">
  <div class="container">
    <h3 class="text-center">What are some other significant benefits you can expect by <br> getting cover from us?</h3>
